# GraphQL Sample Application

This application is intended to showcase how a basic Apollo Server GraphQL implementation can communicate and make use of a microservice-based architecture. The schema consists of a single query, namely "getFact" which is used to retrieve a random fact from an API.

## IMPORTANT

The ENV file required to run this implementation has been sent over inside the email with subject "Coding Challenge - Kristiyan Nikolov Doykov" and needs to be placed at the root of teh directory, alongside the `src` folder.

## Running

In order to run the development environment, please use `npm run start:dev`.

## Testing

In order to run the test suite please use `npm run test`.

## Disclaimer

For the purposes of this excercise no user input was neeeded, however should there have been user input present, an easy way to clear that would have been to use an external npm package like `validator`.
